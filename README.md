## Introduction
This is a simple project to add watermark to an image. When we decorate our hourse, we need to communiate with our designer, tell her what style we like and what we don't. So I use this program to add watermask to pictures.

## A Sample
#### Original Image
<img src="./src/test.jpg" width="300"/>  


#### Image with watermark  
<img src="./sample.yes.jpg" width="300"/>
<img src="./sample.no.jpg" width="300"/>

## How to use
The source code is very simple, change it if you want. 
Put the base file in **src** folder, watermark file in **watermark** folder. Run
	
	```
	node app.js
	```
The result will show in dst folder. So just so simple, try it if you need.
